We will be building and enhancing on the IronLibary for the remainder of the cohort.

We start with the base objectives of a library: Books. We will build upon this throughout the cohort.
Delivery

Turn in both a link to the GitHub Repo and the Heroku instance.
Normal Mode

    You must use the Pull Request workflow to bring features into your master branch
    Create a Rails application which can manage (CRUD) a collection of books, each with an Author. A Book will have a title, a photo_url, a price. The Author should have a first_name, last_name, and a bio.
    You should be able to manage the books, select an author
    It should be styled with Bootstrap or custom.
    For the README.md, add screenshots, an MIT LICENSE, and a description of what the app can do.
    Deploy the application to Heroku.

Epic Mode

Research the mechanize gem, which enables you to scrape a webpage. Then, scrape the best selling books of 2015/2016 from http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2015/books/ and build your Bookshelf from it.
